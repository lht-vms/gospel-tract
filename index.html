            <h2>We Have Fallen Short</h2>
            <p>Yet something broke. Sin entered the world, and we all have fallen short of God's perfect standard. We've chosen our own way instead of His. We've acted in selfishness, pride, and rebellion. This separation from God is not just about mistakes—it's about a broken relationship that we cannot fix on our own.</p>
            <div class="scripture">
                "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
                <cite>— Romans 3:23</cite>
            </div>
            <p>The consequence of sin is death—eternal separation from God. We cannot earn our way back through good deeds or religious efforts. The gap is too great.</p>

            <h2>Jesus: The Living Vine</h2>
            <p>But God's love didn't stop there. In the greatest act of love in history, God sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to bridge that gap. Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't live, and then He willingly died on the cross, taking the punishment for our sins upon Himself.</p>
            <div class="scripture">
                "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing."
                <cite>— John 15:5</cite>
            </div>
            <p>Jesus didn't just die—He rose again three days later, conquering death and proving His power over sin and the grave. He offers us life, abundant and eternal.</p>

            <h2>His Amazing Love</h2>
            <p>Why would God do this? Because He loves you deeply and personally. Not because you earned it or deserve it, but because love is who He is. He knows everything about you—your joys, your pain, your regrets—and He still chose to die for you.</p>
            <div class="scripture">
                "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
                <cite>— Romans 5:8</cite>
            </div>
            <p>This is grace: undeserved, unearned love poured out freely. Jesus invites you to receive this gift, not through your effort, but through faith in Him.</p>

            <h2>Made Righteous</h2>
            <p>When you trust in Jesus, something miraculous happens. God sees you not as you are, but as Jesus is—perfectly righteous. Your sins are forgiven, washed clean. You are adopted into God's family, becoming His beloved child.</p>
            <div class="scripture">
                "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."

            </div>
            <p>And this isn't just about the future—it changes everything now. You are given new life, a new heart, and the Holy Spirit to guide and empower you. You can experience God's presence, purpose, and peace today.</p>

            <h2>Eternity with Him</h2>
            <p>And the promise extends forever. When this life ends, those who trust in Jesus will spend eternity with Him in a place with no more pain, tears, or sorrow. A place of perfect joy, beauty, and love beyond imagination.</p>
            <div class="scripture">
                "He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."
